# Disease-Prediction

📌 Overview

The Disease Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Google Colabs with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.
